			Far Cry 4 is a 2014 first-person shooter game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the successor to the 2012 video game Far Cry 3, and the fourth main installment in the Far Cry series. Set in the fictional Himalayan country of Kyrat, the game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, who becomes caught in a civil war between Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in role-playing games, such as a branching storyline and side quests. The game also features a map editor and both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.</p>

<p>Announced in May 2014, development on Far Cry 4 began immediately after the shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that continues the narrative, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and story for the game. Certain aspects of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the design of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. Troy Baker was hired to portray Pagan Min. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.</p>

<p>Far Cry 4 was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One in November 2014. It received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some reviewes disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A spin-off title, Far Cry Primal, was released in February 2016. A successor, Far Cry 5, was released in March 2018.

					Ubisoft Divertissements Inc., doing business as Ubisoft Montreal, is a Canadian video game developer and a studio of Ubisoft based in Montreal.</p>

<p>The studio was founded in April 1997 as part of Ubisoft's growth into worldwide markets, with subsidies from the governments of Montreal, Quebec, and Canada to help create new multimedia jobs. The studio's initial products were low-profile children's games based on existing intellectual property. Ubisoft Montreal's break-out titles were 2002's Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and 2003's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Subsequently, the studio continued to develop sequels and related games in both series, and developing its own intellectual properties such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Watch Dogs, and For Honor.</p>

<p>As of 2021, the studio employs more than 4,000 staff, making it one of the largest game development studios in the world. The studio also helped to establish Montreal as a creative city, and brought other video game developers to establish studios there..

				Ubisoft Montreal is the principal developer for games in the Assassin's Creed, Prince of Persia, Far Cry, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six, and Watch Dogs seri es, among other titles. However, this does not mean that they develop all the titles in these franchises, and more often than not, other Ubisoft studios support them with development.
				  </p>
          <p>
					The establishment of Ubisoft Montreal is considered to have significant impact on Montreal. The Mile End area over the next several years transformed from a low-rent area to a commercial hub with new businesses, stores, restaurants and other attractions for the young workforce
				  </p>
          <p>
				 For the city overall, Ubisoft Montreal was the first major video game studio and helped to establish its position as a creative city. Several other publishers, including Electronic Arts, Eidos Interactive, THQ and Warner Bros., established studios in Montreal following Ubisoft, with the Quebec and federal governments continuity to offer subsidiary programs to support high-tech job creation.
				  </p>
          <p>
					In exchange, the studio has spent up to CA$3.5 billion in the province of Quebec, and with their parent publisher, helped to open Ubisoft Quebec in Quebec City in 2005 and Ubisoft Saguenay in Saguenay in 2018 to help support Ubisoft Montreal's efforts
				  </p>
          <p>
					The studio began with 50 employees, with half having coming from Ubisoft's Montreuil headquarters, and the other hired in under the government subsidies.
